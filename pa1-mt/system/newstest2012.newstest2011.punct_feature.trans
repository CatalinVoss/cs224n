parliament has not ratified the amendment for the liberation of tymosenko
the ukrainian parliament has refused , in the context of an amendment to the criminal law , the project cancellation paragraph establishing charges of julia tymosenko , the head of the opposition .
members have refused in second reading of the proposed amendment reduction of penalties for economic crimes , which could open the doors of freedom for the former minister currently in prison .
in october tymosenko was sentenced to seven years in prison for reaching an agreement in essence disadvantageous with russia for the purchase of natural gas .
the ruling is not final and the tribunal must decide on the appeal of the sentenced in december .
tymosenko described the judgement of political revenge in the regime and caused a process of suspicion of the court also to the west .
the project to cancel the paragraph 365 of criminal law , on the basis of which the minister was sentenced , was signed by 147 deputies .
it would have taken 226 votes to approve it .
victory libyan
the release or rebellion libyan has already overcome .
muammar kaddafi is buried in an unknown place in the desert and without him the war is over .
it remains to determine the winners .
as is customary in the region , the winners in elections are the islamists , but is this of moderates or radicals .
the interim national council has the right of sharia and we already know what it is .
libya becomes a country without crime because for a flight is cut the hand .
women can forget emancipation , not respect possible faith are capital punishment ...
it is the quran which will unite in place of the personality of the dictator the society consisting of tribes .
in libya reign such an order as we can not represent and as we would surely not .
but our way of life is not unique , is not objectively the best and would probably not for libyans .
it is particularly surprising that the warriors have accepted the islamists help with recognition of dogs infidels .
the only excuse is that this is not a general who led the nato raids , but allah , which they hailed the grandeur to each attack .
when it looking the winners in libya , the west is not included .
we participated in the fire , served islam and our walked away from the dictator as political ally without no profit .
after the recent bad experiences of afghanistan and iraq , we do not militarily libya .
there are therefore no problem for the premises of get rid of " crusaders " .
do without land , oil companies have easy access to the black gold .
perhaps not quite and the west will finally boast of protection of human rights .
if we these followers of the sharia .

since the beginning it is more than 12,000 students in the third who have registered with this project .
a determining factor that cause a dramatic increase the number of children are overweight or obese , is the lack of adequate food , and not enough physical exercise .
" only half of the children queried , for example , indicates eat 5 times per day small case - lunch - enjoy - dinner , which is a basic principles of good nutrition , " says one of the results of the investigation .

on health

the stylist must also be a good psychologist , say the professionals
an article in presentation establishing the way to learn for the designers , i started a little angry of the fact that there were many from the beginning .
what was going to happen .
the statement of three professionals specialty , clothing of characters and a seminar on what is going on .
and it will be worse .
the more we approach the final exams and more ahead practical exercises and information .
and even when there are courses on saturday and sunday is truly " packed " .
this time we have with the director alenka ( during there is no boy ) treaty of how to dress the woman who has no measurements standards .
and women of this type is the majority .
one was a small neck , the other a boy , without curve special , another of overweight .
the designer must know how optically arm wide , a neck or add curves necessary .
we arrived and to highlight nicely character and also not to dress conspicuous of the types of women like jennifer lopez with a broad chest and hips and one size .
if there is a difference between the waist and hips in such a way that the skirts or pants do not at all , it 's worth the request .
and you will not regret it because clothing falling impeccably is priceless .
in a skirt on you feel much better than the sliding constantly , spirals and does not belt and so on .
for those who have a look male have can afford a clothing style tucker , with pieces of fabric sewn , or embroidery .
certainly there are a lot of examples of appearances diverse and i am pleased that i all week to sort all the information received .
but i also afraid that what i should do in the house there too .
each trainee received a celebrity to dress for the day and evening .
we must take into account the present appearance , the type of the personality and his appearance .
i have " dress " miranda kerr , that maybe you know of the campaign the secret of victoria .
i thought of , it gives me pleasure , because it is better than to dress britney spears , christina aguilera who took almost a hundred kilograms lately ( do n't take my statement , please , completely seriously ) or the young selena gomez .
we must cut and sewing from magazines or internet , print and work graphics .
the , as they say to the final result , expresses our personal style and that our relationship with the graphic design .
think about graphic part of the styling is also important .
the designer do not dress like only thus the physical but creates for example the pages productive in magazines ( on the products trends for handbags , coats , etc. ) .
mario , stylist and graphic designer , we had all this .
but that , until sunday ...
the designer shall have a general vision
three guests of specialty gave a aspect diverse session of saturday filled with information about the different types of characters .
honza , fashion designer , jakub graphic designer and ben , fashion photographer .
jakub reminded us that the fashion is an illusion and the stylist should know the use .
and a stylist talent knows work with a single clothing differently .
the variability is very important for this example .
as for example this trench that must be taken in a classical way with jeans and a t-shirt as a light coat but also it can also dress the naked body , with and the picture as a dress .
or he back sleeves or the collar and have immediate a new look .
" play with this " he pointed out .
but i particularly appreciated the following advice : " for the work you need to know the rules perfectly . "
" you can then start to combat , " said jakub .
finally i understand why we trying to learn these rules , what to do with , what , why , while in fashion magazines are sometimes something else .
no declaration on the fashion shows .
i know of new , thanks to the fashion photographer ben that the designer should have much more variants of clothing , those who are photographed .
it is to say that for fashion story that will have a dozen of pages ( so a dozen of models ) i must be ready to cut in " " at least fifteen .
and also , clothing and his combination with other elements appear completely differently .
we must reckon with this with a creation of a model .
the fact that the image and style sometimes half the successful was confirmed by honza .
just look madonna , who is not a super singer but its image and the marketing made it a star world .
in the czech republic , the approach to the use of services designers still weak vessel .
and the familiar faces sometimes regard as useless ( i know anything but what i ’ve happening ranked second ) .
and if someone gets a styling of our part , we must rely on the fact that we dictates with a significant probability a size completely different ( smaller ) that it has actually .
we have to browse google and ascertain whether the info boulevard reflects the celebrity in question , if she has lost or undergoing etc. . .
honza and mario did ask us sunday on the heart it not enough designer to orient in the fashion and know assemble models .
they are to contact with the people he dressed and it is therefore important to be a good psychologist .
know guess people , do not flatter itself , keep his opinion .
" when a manager asks you to sort his wardrobe and the complete new elements you ca n't just throw and tell him , my god horror . "
" you find some cases that you will find beautiful and him that you advise what wear , " says mario .
showed concretely what must contain what is called the " " bag or the fashion designer .
this is the one you cling around the waist and you have on self in all you need .
furthermore things clearly defined as scissors , rollers hair removal or the safety pins , , there is also the nylon wire ( that the designer use to photograph of products such as bags , or hats ) , clips special with close clothing in the back , if it is too great ( the pin or another kind of special-purpose are not because they could damage the clothing ) or a sewing kit .
for that we not only people who listen but that have tried something practical way they taught us how correctly shoes .
and during the photo shoot in the workshop where the surface is equal , the soles could drowning , particularly awards .
and so we spliced and pasted .
we did not have the right to receive the scissors to injury inadvertently .
so we really skills .
mario i was glad when congratulated me for my creation .
the that i am state is not for my girlfriend .
this is only a small summary of what we have learned in the second weekend of during
i starting to understand that the styling a profession is not a walk in a garden of roses , that people say what he wants .
the need for speed the runner sweat across america .
revision
originally a race without problem due to a set of stupid mistakes with people who have nothing to do in a routine displacement early to work .
it fills up to a certain extent the goal of everybody but it achieves nothing if nobody wants to do something .
the new party subtitled the run produced high expectations before its output .
he promised to take a new direction with the race series of need for speed already aged and a kind of play parts playable constituent that does not only with points .
so we were going to be the curious how passages added during which the main protagonist out of his car and does what he wants .
as has already been done in the series nfs , the outcome is completely more than what .
this are potentially racing games arcade but the whole drags down because of a few grammar unnecessary that already exist for several years .
they are not really mistakes , but the expression of an laziness incomprehensible on the part of the developers .
the adventure begins very well .
you are caught in the adventure the lead jack problems personality and to pay starts to participate in races illegal across america .
you sit down behind the wheel on the west coast in san francisco and your mission is to get the first to new york .
the idea of interesting points .
the route is divided into ten steps and then in over 50 races .
this fact that each race on a different route and the steps in different environments who stand out quite well of each other and are interesting .
the player did not feel a moment that the game proposes something of identical .
certain environments are worries enough nice even if the level graphic technique is the same type as the previous rounds .
lastly , this is not the end of the world .
but the actions across the desert , in autumn or in mountains highly snow-covered is very pleasant visually .
the prints are more time to time , is an element .
for example in the desert you find yourself in a sandstorm you declines significantly the visibility .
